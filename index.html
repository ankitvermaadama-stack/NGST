    <h3>About the Symposium</h3>
    <p>
        Glass is a critical material underpinning strategic sectors such as renewable energy,
        construction, automotive, pharmaceuticals, and advanced electronics. With India’s
        rapid infrastructure growth and large-scale solar deployment, the demand for
        high-performance and specialty glass is increasing at an unprecedented pace.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite strong academic research and growing industrial capacity, a visible gap exists
        between laboratory-scale innovation and large-scale industrial implementation.
        The National Symposium on Glass Science & Technology (NSGST-2026) is conceived as
        a focused national platform to bridge this gap through structured interaction between
        researchers, academicians, technologists, and industry professionals.
